## Phonebook_Management_System

This is a simple but efficient phone book record managing system. 

It's implemented from scratch in C++. 
It utilizes the concept of linked list and sorting.

For now I haven't included comments in the code and file handling is also ignored.
But I'll try to add them up asap.

The code is well-suited to beginners (in DSA). 

Hope u like it! :)
